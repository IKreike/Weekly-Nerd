            <h2>Stop Using JS for That</h2>
            <p>Killian Valkhof || Date</p>
            <p>On the World Wide Web, there are an infinite number of ways to solve each problem. These are the most
                useful tips and tricks, and how to apply them.</p>
            <h3>Rule of the Least Power</h3>
            <p>The Rule of the Least Power means that you should choose to write in the least powerful language suitable
                for the task. This way, the browser doesn't have to work as hard, which improves performance and results
                in a better user experience. On the Web, both HTML and CSS are lighter than JavaScript.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The browser doesn't have to work as hard</li>
                <li>HTML and CSS are lighter languages than JS</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>HTML and CSS Tricks</h3>
            <p>There are many features in standard HTML and CSS that, when used correctly, eliminate the need for
                JavaScript.</p>
            <h4>Custom Switches</h4>
            <p>If you want to make a custom switch, start with <code>appearance: none;</code>. This resets the default
                styling
                applied by the browser while keeping its functionality intact. When redesigning, consider the
                <code>:focus-visible</code> pseudo-class for keyboard navigation.
            </p>

                <p>This Weekly Nerd by Killian was a good start to the minor—it broadened my perspective and opened my
                    eyes to the possibilities of the World Wide Web. It provides a solid foundation for techniques and
                    terms that will be used later in the minor.</p>

        <article id="peter">
            <h2>Pay the Web Forward with Web Monetization</h2>
            <p>Peter-Paul Koch || 26-2-25</p>
            <p>The decision for the web to be free was made in the late ’90s. This has become a bad habit that we should
                change. The way people currently make money on the web is through the use of ads. This has two effects:
                the user thinks they don’t have to do anything, and all users only get the results that rich people and
                companies want us to see.</p>
            <h3>What Do We Want?</h3>
            <p>As website developers, we want our work to be appreciated and valued properly. Currently, a good site
                takes a lot of work and earns barely anything. If visitors give money on their own initiative,
                developers will be encouraged to improve their sites so users stay longer or return more often.</p>
            <h3>How Can We Do This?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>We need to set up an online bank account, directly connected to a real bank account. For this, we
                    need to be able to verify our customers’ identities.</li>
                <li>We need a browser extension to manage this. We are working with multiple browsers to integrate this
                    into the browsers themselves.</li>
                <li>We need to define a standard amount of money to be paid and when. The customer must be able to
                    change this.</li>
                <li>We need to comply with international regulations. Currently, the EU can only pay for EU-based
                    websites,
                    and the same applies to the USA. We need to establish a chain of trust between the organizations.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Support</h3>
            <p>A link tag in the head of the HTML is checked by the browser extension. An initial signal is sent to
                establish a connection. Afterwards, the money is sent either by the streaming method (sent live) or
                post-paid
                (sent afterward, with a good internet connection).</p>

                <p>A Weekly Nerd, or a sales pitch? Peter-Paul Koch told us about payments on the web, and his reasons
                    seemed very ethical and strong. His view on the state and the future of the internet opened my
                    eyes. It did seem to melt into a sales pitch, which was a shame. I don’t know enough about it
                    to ask accurate questions, but the questions my classmates asked made me doubt his product.</p>

        <!-- weekly nerd #3, beyond tweening -->
        <article id="cassie">
            <h2>Beyond Tweening</h2>
            <p>Cassie Evans || 7-3-25</p>
            <p>Cassie Evans works for GSAP, an animation library with which you can animate anything!</p>

            <h3>Main Elements</h3>
            <p>The GSAP library contains two main elements, with which you can make the whole library work.</p>

            <h4>Tween</h4>
            <p>The method used to call and use the library. It commonly looks like this:</p>
            <p class="code">
                <!-- <span>p</span>
        de tekst die in het ding staat!
        <span>/p</span> -->
                gsap.
                <span class="element">to</span>(
                '<span>.box</span>'
                <span class="element">(x=20d)</span>)
            </p>
            <p>This string consists of:</p>
            <p class="code">
                call gsap
                <span class="element">method</span>
                <span>object</span>
                <span class="element">method</span>
            </p>

            <h4>Timelines</h4>
            <p>Timelines are used to time your animations and are similar in use to how animations in After Effects
                work. For example, this makes the standard animations play one after another instead of at the same
                time.</p>

            <h3>Animation Toolbox</h3>
            <p>When you are writing code, you often use only what you know and don't think about new ways to do it.
                There are
                many better ways to do things, but you need to know which tools to use and where to find them.</p>
            <p class="quote">"To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail." - Mark Twain</p>

            <h4>Useful Features</h4>

            <h5>Utils</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>random</li>
                <li>mapRange</li>
                <li>wrap</li>
                <li>pipe</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Easing</h5>
            <p>With the GSAP Ease Visualizer, it's very easy to test your easings before implementing them in your
                code. It also has a feature to directly implement the easings into CSS.</p>

            <section class="ad">

            <section class="reflection">
                <h4>Reflection #3</h4>
                <p>I had never used or heard of GSAP before, which made the introduction mildly interesting and the code
                    examples somewhat useless. The lecture did make me interested in trying out the library, though not
                    for a specific project or using the highlighted features.</p>

        <!-- weekly nerd #4, declarative design -->
        <article id="jeremy">
            <h2>Declarative Design</h2>
            <p>Jeremy || 12-3-25</p>
            <p>There are two approaches to design in the workplace: declarative and imperative. Neither is wrong,
                neither is right, but we’re going to go over some highlights of both methods.</p>

            <h3>First, the Basics</h3>
            <p>With imperative design, you work with precise instructions.
                With declarative design, you work with the output you want and let the software figure out how to get
                there.</p>

            <h3>How Does This Apply to the World Wide Web?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML – declarative</li>
                <li>CSS – declarative</li>
                <li>JavaScript – imperative</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This makes both HTML and CSS fault-tolerant, while JavaScript stops execution if there is an error in the
                code.</p>
            <p class="quote">“JavaScript should only do what only JavaScript can do.”</p>

            <h3>Why Does It Matter?</h3>
            <p>This distinction between mindsets is, at its root, a difference in control. Why do you choose to make
                your own button, or to trust the browser to make one for you? Do you see the code the browser gives you
                as features or as bugs? My advice: let the browser work for you.</p>

            <h3>Something About Assumptions</h3>
            <p>Make more text here.</p>
            <p class="quote">"Be the browser’s mentor (imperative), not its micromanager (declarative)."</p>

            <h3>Thinking About Thinking</h3>
            <p>Text here as well — systems in the real world.</p>

            <section class="reflection">
                <h4>Reflection #4</h4>
                <p>This lecture by Jeremy was really interesting, and he is a great storyteller. You could tell he
                    is willing to share his experience and knowledge and is not trying to sell us anything. Key points
                    are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Find the culture that fits</li>
                    <li>Find the way of working that fits you</li>

            <p>What is a hacker? Somebody with a hoodie and sunglasses typing green numbers on a computer all day?
                – No! A hacker is a person skilled in information technology who achieves goals using non-standard

            <p>You just try stuff? Something wonderful might happen. I myself tried making image magic: Photoshop with

            <h2>Geld verdienen met project FUGU</h2>
            <p>Niels leenheer || 9-4-25</p>
            <p>Project FUGU Makes Native web applications, things that work in the browser and on the Internet. How do
                you do this for a register?</p>
            <p>Analog appliances have different end points for different functionalities. Which was originally probably
                a great idea, but now we need to figure out which endpoint to send the information to, and in which
                language. </p>
            <h3>ASCII</h3>
            <p>A lot of the languages are build on a ASCII language system. This means letters numbers and symbols are
                placed on a grid, with the y axes being first and the x axes being second. In the below example this
                would entail that A has the sign 41.</p>
            <img src="./assets/asciiTable.jpg"
                alt="ASCII table. The A stands on the row numbered 4 in column numbered 1">
            <p>Then, you have the issue of which type letter to use, and how to tell the machine this. For this, we use
                commando (esc) language.</p>
            <p class="code">Esc E 1</p>
            <p>In this, we start the command with the esc sign, which tells the machine a code is coming. The second
                sigil is what we want to interact with, in this case E for emphasis, bold text. The 1 means we put in
                on, a zero in this would end the emphasized line. </p>
            <h3>What about images?</h3>
            <p>Well, if you take an image, convert it to black and white, then place the pixels in rows of three, then
                translate it though some codes it might just about work. If you need to do this, I wrote a library for
                it. Saves a lot of headache.</p>
            <p class="quote">“If somebody says – you don’t need another receipt printer - Ignore Them!”</p>
            <h3>libraries</h3>
            <p>The restrictions of the 70’s make for some interesting choices, but lucky for you there exist libraries
                now! You don’t need to do this the way I did. Please don’t. Save yourself the headache.</p>
            <section class="reflection">
                <h4>Reflection #6</h4>
                <p>Niels Leenheer came to talk about registers. The conclusion basically was: If you’re gonna do it,
                    don’t — because I did it for you, and it HURT. The secondary message was: Things communicate in
                    different languages. It was fun to learn more about how computers think, alphabets, and the 0's and
                    1's of it all. It showed how deep the rabbit hole sometimes goes, and I hope to be as passionate
                    about a subject to follow it down the rabbit hole as far as he is willing to.</p>

            <p>You should be able to use Tab and Shift+Tab to reach all interactive elements on the page. A link to skip
                the navigation when necessary saves minutes of time and repeated information. A controlled focus state
                makes the website clearer. And remember the biggest sin of all: a div with a role of button.</p>

            <p class="code hooks">
                <span class="element">div</span>
                <span>role</span>="button"
            </p>

            <p>This makes the entire element inaccessible by keyboard.</p>

            <h3>Contrast</h3>
            <p>You might think contrast isn’t a regular problem, but when the sun shines, it becomes
                a problem for everybody.</p>

            <p>The contrast ratio should be 3:1 for large text (24+ px) and bold text (19+ px). All other text should
                have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.</p>
            <!-- [examples?] -->

            <h3>Alternatives</h3>
            <p>Captions, transcripts, and text alternatives for images. These don’t always have to be in the code—if you
                add
                them to your site, they help everyone. Even when there’s no audio, it’s very useful to know that!
                Common problems include images in buttons or links, and video content.</p>

            <h3>Sizing</h3>
            <p>The internet should be functional at all shapes and sizes—even on a screen that’s only 320px wide.
                External content like cookie banners and popups often overlook this, so consider whether you really need
                those services.</p>

            <h2>Thinking Outside the Accessibility Box</h2>
            <p>Nienke de Keizer || 16-4-25</p>
            <p>During my internship at GVB, I noticed that the app is not as accessible as it should be. For my master's
                assignment, I decided to research and redesign it, focusing on people with limited vision.</p>
            <p class="quote">“Accessibility is made for a small group, but they matter.”</p>
            <p>A very practical example of new technology being inaccessible to people with limited vision is
                the introduction of electric buses. Previously, people would listen to the diesel engines to
                know a bus was arriving. Now that those sounds are gone, a new system has been implemented in the
                signage that announces bus arrivals audibly.</p>
            <p>Previously, the ReisAssist app was created for the visually impaired. In the long term, this new app
                might replace that or the outdated techniques currently used in the app.</p>
            <p>Nienke de Keizer has introduced accessibility improvements to GVB.</p>

            <section class="reflection">
                <h4>Reflection #7</h4>
                <p>Nienke's talk was very intimidating. Is that supposed to be me in two years? Am I on the
                    right track, and passionate enough? Her work was impressive and important, and I admire her for what
                    she
                    does.</p>
                <p>Erik’s talk had useful information, though it wasn’t entirely new. It’s good to emphasize these
                    points again because they’re often forgotten. It all seems so simple—and in practice, it *is*
                    simple! You just have to think about it.</p>

            <h2>The Rise of AI-Powered Voice Interfaces</h2>
            <p>Dave Bitter || 15-5-25</p>
            <p>Voice recognition has existed and been developed since 1950. It has slowly been changing the way
                people find information. From having microphone detection in your search bar to now whole AIs and
                applications built on this concept, developments in the last few years have been fast and successful.
                The newest AI tools all contain 4 key parts.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Speech recognition – API</li>
                <li>Speech synthesis – API</li>
                <li>Connection with the AI – what is said and what is the response</li>
                <li>Personality and feedback to the user – what the user sees</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But it doesn’t feel quite natural yet. Using another AI, we could imitate human speech patterns with
                intonation. However, the step to send the information back and forth as a whole creates big delays,
                making the conversation slow and unnatural.</p>
            <p>To fix this problem, I cut up the response of the AI into separate sentences and ‘humanised’ the
                information while it was speaking, thus removing some of the delay and making the conversation more
                fluent.</p>

            <h2>Twitter follow bot and follower scraper</h2>
            <p>Steve Jonk || 14-5-25</p>
            <p>I once got asked by a marketing bureau to make a Twitter bot that follows all followers of another
                account. Let me show you how I did it. Disclaimer: this is not entirely legal.</p>
            <h3>Tools</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>N8n – automiser of a workflow</li>
                <li>Puppeteer – browser automation</li>
                <li>Twitter API</li>
                <li>PostgreSQL – database</li>
                <li>Docker – containerisation</li>
                <li>Ubuntu – server</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Obstacles</h3>
            <p>Making and using a bot is against Twitter’s terms of service. So I had to make my bot seem as if it was
                not a machine, and act like a human. I will follow, pause, and after a randomised amount of time
                unfollow or follow the next person.</p>
            <p>The next obstacle I encountered was how to get the data. Twitter has an API of their own, but to use
                it to the extent that I needed, the cost would be in the five figures. So, I used a scraper to get
                publicly accessible follower information from the internet. However, this information is only available
                on different pages. So again, randomise and pause.</p>
            <h3>Final product</h3>
            <p>In the end, I made a working product that took longer than expected, is visually supported by n8n, and
                is borderline illegal.</p>
            <p>Conclusion: it can be very lucrative to work for yourself in this field.</p>

            <h3>Confidence in your code</h3>
            <p>There is only one valid way to gain confidence in your code: lots and lots of testing. I recommend these:

        <article id="master">
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>Iris || 8-5-25</p>
            <h3>Learning goals for the master assignment</h3>
            <h4>CSS Layout & Structure</h4>
            <p>I have learned a lot about style and css in this minor, but i think there is more to learn. I have
                tried
                multiple times to incorperate grid-area, yet have never succeeded. In the master assigment i would
                like
                to practice with different kinds of grid-styling and structure.</p>
            <p>By the end of the project, I can write consistent, scalable CSS using modern layout techniques,
                including
                CSS Grid, Subgrid, Container Queries, and Grid Areas. I will demonstrate this by developing
                responsive
                components or pages that apply these techniques effectively.</p>
            <h4>Team Collaboration</h4>
            <p>A part of the Hackathon that i found most diffecult was working together with my teammates. Partly
                because i had never collaborated on such a project before. I also found it hard to understand what
                my
                team was doing, and felt I was making things without thinking. I would like to change this and do
                better
                during this assigment.</p>
            <p>Throughout the project, I will actively contribute to team discussions, give and respond to feedback,
                and
                reflect on my own role and communication within the team through weekly updates and in my product
                biography.</p>
            <h4>Proffessional documentation</h4>
            <p>In my last feedback for API I got some tips and tricks about making a readme proffessional and
                usable. I
                think practicing this is a great skill to practice and will improve productbiography's and maybe
                even
                this collection of weekly Nerds. </p>
            <p>Throughout the project, I will maintain clear and structured documentation of my design and
                development
                process by updating my product biography weekly. This will include design iterations, technical
                decisions, team contributions, feedback received, and how it influenced the product, making the
                rationale behind the project traceable and reviewable.</p>
            <h4>Accessibility</h4>
            <p>During this minor and especially during the weekly nerds there was an emphasis on accesibility. In
                the
                last few weeks of the minor Id like to dive a little deeper in it myself.</p>
            <p>I will apply accessibility best practices throughout the project, including semantic HTML, proper
                color
                contrast, keyboard navigability, and screen reader support. I will test these aspects and document
                how
                accessibility was addressed in both design and code.</p>

        <article id="reflection">
            <h2>Subject Reflection</h2>
            <p>Iris || 7-5-25</p>

            <h3>Web Apps From Scratch</h3>
            <p>The WAFS week was very useful to get back into the flow of coding. It was fun to have the freedom
                to make literally anything. It helped me brush up on my terminology and coding tricks, and I learned
                some new ones in the process.</p>

            <h3>CSS to the Rescue</h3>
            <p>This was a very fun subject to take a deep dive into. It forced me to think outside the box (in my
                case, maybe a bit too much for Sanne’s taste) and it taught me to style quickly and just try things
                if I think they might work. I did notice that I struggled with using some techniques because they
                were new, since my intuition is usually to learn new things only when they become necessary.</p>

            <h3>Browser Technologies</h3>
            <p>BT showed me how useful HTML elements are and how much they can do on their own. It inspired me
                to look a bit further when searching for a feature, because it might already exist.</p>

            <h3>Hackathon</h3>

            <h4>Concept</h4>
            <p>The concept for the hackathon project was an infinite scroll screen where all the Women of Tech had
                a card. Clicking on a card would open a popup with more information about that person. The goal was
                to create a giant wall of fame, giving each person a place to shine and be acknowledged.</p>

            <h4>Experimental Tech</h4>
            <p>I took this assignment to experiment with some new tech, mostly in CSS. Most notably were the clamp
                function (we were even nicknamed “Clampers”) and the “use” tag for SVGs.</p>

            <h4>My Contribution</h4>
            <p>I created a pure CSS animation to indicate the canvas could be swiped. I coded the extended card
                displayed when more information about a Woman in Tech is requested. I also worked with and transformed
                the SVGs of the countries.</p>

            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>The beginning is always the hardest part of an assignment. Not only due to doubt and insecurity, but
                also mental and physical exhaustion — battles fought and hurdles encountered. In an assignment with a
                duration of less than four days, these issues are amplified. For the first two days, I was unable to
                be my best self and deliver my best work, which is a crucial moment in the decision-making process.
                I am very glad for my team and that we got this far.</p>

            <h3>API</h3>
            <p>I learned a lot during API. I was ambitious with my goal of making a chat website, but with the help
                of Declan and Cyd, it turned out better than expected. I am really proud of what I made, and I do
                understand what I did, although I doubt I could recreate it on my own. Sadly, there were a few bugs,
                partly due to it being put online, but I still had many ideas on how to improve at the end of the
                course.</p>

            <h3>HCD</h3>
            <p>This was a really fun project to work on. I started with the idea of a sound graph, but through tests
                and experience, it transformed into lines moving up and down, moving shapes, and the addition of
                emojis and subtitles. It was really rewarding to dive into the requirements of one specific person and
                find creative solutions to common problems.</p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>And if i reached them</p>
            <h3>CSS layout and structure</h3>
            <p>During this project, I challenged myself to use and research new grid and flexbox techniques. It was in
                this project that I finally managed to get grid-area working. I had tried to implement this in projects
                before but had never succeeded.</p>
            <p>I based my grid on Liam's design. In that design, the title of the card was part of the relation box, and
                the idea was to have it separate from the other items in the HTML. However, due to the way grid works,
                these items would stack and not order themselves in a box. Due to this, I decided to alter the design
                slightly so the title would be at the top, separate from other relations.</p>
            <p>During this time, Matthijs was working on a component similar to mine. When he wanted to try his hand at
                learning grid and making a grid for the component, I was able to help him get set up with an
                explanation, some useful sites, and a few sketches.</p>
            <p>For the mobile-scaled version, I debated using container queries vs media queries. However, since only
                the card itself needed to scale, and not its contents, I opted for using media queries</p>
            <p>During my discovery, I also came across the columns property, which automatically sorts items in columns,
                with scalable widths, lines in between, and a whole lot of other solutions. I didn’t get to use this in
                the Master Assessment, but I did use it in the Weekly Nerd (see the wide articles).</p>
            <h3>Team Collaboration</h3>
            <p>During this second team project of the minor, I wanted to be more of an active member of the group. I do
                think I managed to do this, though I found it difficult to share my ideas and point out flaws I noticed.
                To overcome this social obstacle, I started writing things down, either fixing them myself or bringing
                them up later. This worked for me, opening communication and not causing excess stress.</p>
            <p>Communication within the team during the project was clear. In the first weeks of the project, people
                started working on components, and if there were changes for that part later, the original person fixed
                it. This way, no one would overwrite each other's work or cause conflicts.</p>
            <p>I also made an effort to check in with my teammates more often, to see what they were working on and to
                stay up to date on the latest decisions. I also informed teammates of any decisions I made that could
                affect their work, to prevent unexpected issues.</p>
            <h3>Proffessional documentation</h3>
            <p>To complete my goal of improving my documentation, I made sure to update my product biography weekly. To
                do this accurately, I made small updates throughout the week, writing bullet points for different tasks
                and topics that I knew I would expand on later. At the end of the week, or at the start of the next, I
                reviewed all the bullet points and rephrased them, incorporating everything I had learned during the
                week.</p>
            <p>Because I kept my biography up to date, many people — teammates and others — copied my layout. I told
                them this was fine, as it demonstrated that I had created a professional and well-structured biography.</p>
            <p>I also made sure to document our talks with the client. I took notes during the presentations and later
                added them to the wiki, so the whole team could review and access them. This ensured we wouldn’t forget
                any important points and allowed us to acknowledge items that were discussed but not included in the
                project.</p>
