            <h2>Stop using JS for that</h2>
            <p>Killian valkhof || date</p>
            <p>In the world wide web there are an infinite amount of ways to solve each problem. These are the most
                useful tips and tricks and how to apply them.</p>
            <h3>Rule of the Least power</h3>
            <p>The rule of the least power entails that you should choose to write in the language with the least power
                possible for the purpose. In this way, the browser doestn have to think too hard and slow down the
                processes. This makes for a better user experience. In the world wide web are HTML and CSS both lighter
                than Javascript.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Browser does not have to think</li>
                <li>Both HTML and CSS are lighter languages than JS</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Html and css tricks </h3>
            <p>There are many features in standard HTML and css that, when used correctly, eliminates the need for
                javascript. </p>
            <h4>Custom switches </h4>
            <p>If you want to make a custom switch, start with appearance:none; . This resets the standard filled in by
                the browser while keeping its functionality intact. When redesigning think about the focus-visible
                attribute for navigating the page with a keyboard. </p>
            <h4>In page transisitions </h4>
            <h4>The parent selector</h4>

                <h4>reflection- #1</h4>
                <p>This weekly nerd by killian was a good start to the minor- It broadened perspective and opens eyes to
                    possibilities of the world wide web. It is a good base for techniques and terms that are going to be
                    used later in the minor.</p>

        <!-- weekly nerd #2, Pay the web forward -->
        <article id="peter">
            <h2>Pay the web forward with web monitization</h2>
            <p>Peter-paul Koch || 26-2-25</p>
            <p>The decision for the web to be free was made in the late 90’s. This has become a bad habit that we should
                alter. The way people currently make money of the web is throught the use of ads. This has two effects:
                The user thinks they don’t have to do anything and all users only get the results rich people and
                companies want us to see. </p>
            <h3>What do we want?</h3>
            <p>As website developers, we want our work to be appreciated and valued correctly. Currently, a good site
                costs a lot of work and gains barely anything. If visitors give money from their own initiative
                develepers will be encouraged to make their sites better, so users stay on the site longer or visit more
                often.</p>
            <h3>How can we do this?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>We need to set up an online bank account, directly connecter to a real bank account. For this we
                    need to be able to verify our customers identity</li>
                <li>We need a browser extention to manage this. We are working with mulitple browsers to integrate this
                    into the browsers themselves.</li>
                <li>We need to make a standard amount of money paid and when. The customer must be able to change this.
                </li>
                <li>We need to comply with international rules. Currently, they EU can only pay for EU-based websites,
                    same as the USA. We need to establish a chain of trust between the organisations.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Suppport</h3>
            <p>A link tag in the head of the HTML, being checked by the browser extrention. An initial signal is sent to
                establish connection. Afterwards the money will be sent by either the streaming method (sent the money
                live for) or post paid (only sent the money afterwards, with a good internet connection)</p>

                <p>A weekly nerd, or a sales pitch? Peter-paul Koch told us about payments in the web, and his reasons
                    seemed very ethical and strong. His vieuw on the state and the future on the internet opened my
                    eyes. It did seem to melt into a sales pitch, wich was a shame. I myself do not know enough about it
                    to ask accurate questions, however the questions my classmates asked him made me doubt his product.

            <h2>Beyond tweening</h2>
            <p>cassie evans || 7-3-25</p>
            <p>Cassie evans works for GSAP, an animation library with wich you can animate anything!</p>
            <h3>main elements</h3>
            <p>The GSAP library contains 2 main elements, with wich you can make the whole library work</p>
            <h4>tween</h4>
            <p>The method to call and use the library. It commonly looks like this:</p>
            <p class="code">
                <!-- <span>p</span>
                de tekst die in het ding staat!
                <span>/p</span> -->
                gsap.
                <span class="method">to</span>(
                '<span>.box</span>'
                <span class="method">(x=20d)</span>)
            </p>
            <p>These string consists of:</p>
            <p class="code">
                call gsap
                <span class="method">method</span>
                <span>object</span>
                <span class="method">method</span>
            </p>
            <h4>timelines</h4>
            <p>Timelines are used to time your animation, and are similar in use of how animations in after effects
                work. For example, this makes the standard animations play after eachother instead of in the same
                timeframe.</p>
            <h3>animation toolbox</h3>
            <p>When you are writing code, you use only what you know and dont think about new ways to do it. There are
                so many better ways to do things but you need to know wich tools to use and where to find them.</p>
            <p class="quote">"To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail." - Mark Twain</p>
            <h4>Useful features</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>random</li>

                <li>pipe</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Easing</h5>
            <p>With the GSAP ease visualiser it is very easy to to test your easings before implementing it in your
                code. It also has a feature to directly implement the easings into css. </p>

                <h4>reflection</h4>
                <p>I had never used or heard of GSAP before, wich made the introduction mildly interesting and the code
                    examples utterly useless. The lecture did make me interested in trying out the library, however not
                    for a specific project or using the highlighted features.</p>

        <!-- weekly nerd #4, declarative design -->
        <article id="jeremy">
            <h2>Declarative design</h2>
            <p>Jeremy || 12-3-25</p>
            <p>There are two approaches to design in the workfield, declarative and imperative. Neither is wrong,
                neither is right, but we are gonna go over some highlights of both methods.</p>
            <h3>First, the basis</h3>
            <p>With imperative design you work with precise instructions.
                With declarative design you work with the output you want and let the software think about how to get
                there.</p>
            <h3>How does this apply in the World Wide Web</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Html – declarative</li>
                <li>Css - declarative</li>
                <li>Js – imperative</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This makes both html and css fault tolerant, while javascript stops execution if there is an error in the
                code</p>
            <p class="quote">“Javascript should only do what only javascript can do”</p>
            <h3>Why does it matter</h3>
            <p>This distinction between mindsets is, in the root, a difference in control. Why do you choose to make
                your own button, or to trust the browser to make one for you. Do you see the code the browser gives you
                as features or as bugs? My advise- let the browser work for you. </p>
            <h3>something about assumptions</h3>
            <p>make more text here</p>
            <p class="quote">"Be the browsers mentor (imperative) not its micromanager (declarative)"</p>
            <h3>Thinking about thinking </h3>
            <p>text here as well- systems in the real world</p>


            <section class="reflection">
                <h4>reflection</h4>
                <p>This lecture by Jeremy was really interesting, and he is a really good storyteller. You could tell he
                    is willing to share his experience and knowledge and is not trying to sell us anything. Key points
                    are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Find the culture that fits</li>
                    <li>Find the way of working that fits for you</li>
                    <li>Find yourself</li>

            <h2>Practical fixes for common wcag problems</h2>
            <p>Erik kroes || 16-4-25</p>
            <p>There are 4 objects that are so often done wrong and yet so easy to get right. Spending seconds to think
                about these problems will make the web more accessible. An accessible product is a product that’s usable
                by everybody, including people with disability’s.</p>
            <p class="quote">"A hole in the wall is technically accesible because people can get inside."</p>
            <h3>Keyboard</h3>
            <p>You should be able to use tab and shift-tab to get to all interactive objects on the page. A link to skip
                the navigation when nececarry saves minutes of time and repeated information. A controlled focus state
                makes the website clearer. And remember the biggest sin of all: a div with a role of button.</p>
            <p class="code hooks">
                <span class="method">div</span>
                <span>role</span>="button"
            </p>
            <p>This makes the whole thing inaccessable by keyboard.</p>
            <h3>Contrast</h3>
            <p>You might think contrast is not as much of a regular problem, but when the sun shines it becomes a
                problem for everybody.</p>
            <p>The contrast ratio should be 3:1 for large texts (24+ px) and bold texts (19+ px). All other text should
                at least have a contrast of 4.5:1.</p>
            [examples?]
            <h3>Alternatives</h3>
            <p>Captions, transcripts and text alternatives for images. These don’t have to be in the code, if you add
                them to your site it works for everybody. Even when there is no audio, it is very useful to know this!
                Common problems are images in buttons or link, and video content.</p>
            <h3>Sizing</h3>
            <p>The internet should be functional in all shapes and sizes, even if your screen is 320px. External content
                like cookies and popups don’t think about this often, so keep in mind if you really need these services.

            <h2>Thinking outside the accessibility box</h2>
            <p>nienke de keizer || 16-4-25</p>
            <p>In my internship at GVB I noticed the app is not as accesible as it should be, so for my master
                assignment I decided to research and redesign this, focussed on people with limited with sight. </p>
            <p class="quote">“Accesibility is made for a small group, but they matter”</p>
            <p>A very practical example of the new technologie being inaccessable to people with limited sight is the
                new electric busses. To call on the busses previously, people would listen to the dieselmotors to
                announce the arrival of the bus. Now that those are done, a new system has been implemented in the signs
                that calls out the arrival of the busses.</p>
            <p>Previously, the ReisAssist app was made for the for the visually impaired. In the long term, this app
                might replace that or the outdated techniques that are in the current app.</p>
            <p>Nienke de Keizer has introduced accesibility to GVB.</p>
            <section class="reflection">
                <h4>reflection- #7</h4>
                <p>The talk from Nienke was very intimidating. Is that supposed to be me in 2 years? Am i on the right
                    track and passionate enough? Her work was great and important and i admire her for what she does.
                </p>
                <p>The talk from Erik had useful information, though it was not new. It is good to emphasise these
                    points agian because they are so often forgotten. It seems so simple, yet in practice it is simple
                    as well! You just have to think about it.</p>

            <h2>The rise of AI powered voice interfaces </h2>
            <p>dave bitter || 15-5-25</p>
            <p>Voice recognition has existed and been developed since 1950. This has been slowly changing the way people
                find information. From having microphone detection in your search bar to now whole AI’s and applications
                that are build on this concept, the developments in the last few years have been fast and succesful. The
                newest AI tools all contain 4 key parts.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Speech recognition - API</li>
                <li>Speech synthesis - API</li>
                <li>Connection with the AI – what is said and what is the response</li>
                <li>Personality and feedback to the user – what does the user see</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But it doenst feel quite natural yet. Using another AI, we could imitate a human speech pattern with
                intonation. However, the step to sent the information back and forth as a whole creates big delays,
                making the conversation slow and unnatural. </p>
            <p>To fix this problem I cut up the response of the AI in separate sentences, and ‘humanised’ the
                information while it was speaking, thus removing some of the delay and making the conversation more
                fluent.</p>

            <p>I once got asked by a marketing bureau to make a twitter bot that follows all followers of another
                account. Let me show you how I did it. Disclaimer: this is not entirely legal.</p>
            <h3>Tools</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>N8n – automiser of a workflow</li>
                <li>Puppeteer – browser automation</li>
                <li>Twitter API</li>
                <li>Postgreas – database</li>
                <li>Docker – containerisation</li>
                <li>Ubuntu – server</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Obstacles</h3>
            <p>Making and using a Bot is agianst twitters terms of service. So I had to make my bot seem as it was not a
                machine, and to act like a human. I will follow, pause and after a randomised amount of time unfollow or
                follow the next person. </p>
            <p>The next obstacle I encountered was how to get the data. Twitter has an API of themselves, but to use it
                to the extend that I needed it to the cost would be in the five figures. So, I used a scaper to get the
                publicly accesible follower information of the internet. However, this information is only available on
                different pages. So again, randomise and pause. </p>
            <h3>Final product</h3>
            <p>In the end I made a working product that took longer than expected, is visually supported by n8n and is borderline illegal.</p>
            <p>Conclusion: it can be very lucrative to work for yourself in this field.</p>

                <h4>reflection- #5</h4>
                <p>This lecture by Rose went over the mindset: what if you just try it? It really spoke to me personally
                    because i like making weird stuff, and to see it is possible with tech was great. There was not a
                    lot of factual information, however the mindset is one to consider when growing and learning.</p>

                <h4>reflection- #6</h4>
                <p>Niels Leenheer came to talk about registers. The conclusion basicly was: If you are gonna do it, dont
                    because i did it for you and it HURT. The secondary message was: Things communicate in different
                    languages. It was fun to learn more about how computers think, alphabets and the 0's and 1's of it
                    all. It showed how deep the rabbithole sometimes goes, and i hope to be as passionate about a
                    subject to follow it down the rabbithole as far as he is willing to.</p>

        <article id="master">
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>Iris || 8-5-25</p>
            <h3>Learning goals for the master assignment</h3>
            <h4>CSS Layout & Structure</h4>
            <p>I have learned a lot about style and css in this minor, but i think there is more to learn. I have tried
                multiple times to incorperate grid-area, yet have never succeeded. In the master assigment i would like
                to practice with different kinds of grid-styling and structure.</p>
            <p>By the end of the project, I can write consistent, scalable CSS using modern layout techniques, including
                CSS Grid, Subgrid, Container Queries, and Grid Areas. I will demonstrate this by developing responsive
                components or pages that apply these techniques effectively.</p>
            <h4>Team Collaboration</h4>
            <p>A part of the Hackathon that i found most diffecult was working together with my teammates. Partly
                because i had never collaborated on such a project before. I also found it hard to understand what my
                team was doing, and felt I was making things without thinking. I would like to change this and do better
                during this assigment.</p>
            <p>Throughout the project, I will actively contribute to team discussions, give and respond to feedback, and
                reflect on my own role and communication within the team through weekly updates and in my product
                biography.</p>
            <h4>Proffessional documentation</h4>
            <p>In my last feedback for API I got some tips and tricks about making a readme proffessional and usable. I
                think practicing this is a great skill to practice and will improve productbiography's and maybe even
                this collection of weekly Nerds. </p>
            <p>Throughout the project, I will maintain clear and structured documentation of my design and development
                process by updating my product biography weekly. This will include design iterations, technical
                decisions, team contributions, feedback received, and how it influenced the product, making the
                rationale behind the project traceable and reviewable.</p>
            <h4>Accessibility</h4>
            <p>During this minor and especially during the weekly nerds there was an emphasis on accesibility. In the
                last few weeks of the minor Id like to dive a little deeper in it myself.</p>
            <p>I will apply accessibility best practices throughout the project, including semantic HTML, proper color
                contrast, keyboard navigability, and screen reader support. I will test these aspects and document how
                accessibility was addressed in both design and code.</p>

        <article id="reflection">
            <h2>Subject reflection</h2>
            <p>Iris || 7-5-25</p>
            <h3>Web Apps From Scratch</h3>
            <p>The WAFS week was a very useful week to get back into the flow of coding. It was fun to have the freedom
                to make literally anything. It made me brush up on my terms and coding trick, and learned some new ones
                in the process</p>
            <h3>CSS to the resque</h3>
            <p>This was a very fun subject to take a deep dive into. It forces you to think outside the box (in my case
                a bit too much to Sannes taste) and it learned me to style quickly and just try things if I think they
                might work. I did notice that i struggele with using techniques because they are new, because my
                intuition is to learn new things when they become nececarry.</p>
            <h3>Browser Technologies</h3>
            <p>BT showed me how useful HTML elements are and how much they can to on their own. It did inspire me to
                look just a bit further if you are looking for a thing that does something, for it may already exist.
            </p>
            <h3>Hackathon</h3>
            <h4>concept</h4>
            <p>The concept for the hacathon project was a infinite scroll screen where all the woman of tech had a card.
                If you were to click on one of these card a popup would happen with more information about them. This
                concept was made to be a giant wall of fame and to give each person a place to shine and be aknowledged
            </p>
            <h4>experimental tech</h4>
            <p>I took this assigment to experiment with some new tech, mostly in css. Most notable were the clamp
                attribute (we were named clampers after all) and the "use" tag</p>
            <h4>my contribution</h4>
            <p>I made a pure css animation to indicate the canvas being able to be swiped. I coded the extended card,
                displayed when wanting more information about the woman in tech. I also transformed and worked with the
                SVG's of the country's. </p>
            <h4>reflection</h4>
            <p>Beginning is the hardes part of an assignment, this has always been this way. Not only doubt and
                insecurity but mental an physical exhaustion ar battles fought and hurdles encountered. In an assigment
                with a duration less than 4 days these issues amplify. For the first two days i was unable to be my best
                self and deliver my best work, wich is a crucial moment in the decision making progress. I am very glad
                for my team, and that we got this far.
            </p>
            <h3>API</h3>
            <p>I learned a lot during API. I was ambitious with my goal of making a chat website, but with the help of
                Declan and Cyd it turned out better than excpected. I am really proud of what i made, and i do
                understand what I did although i doubt i could recreate it on my own. Sadly there were a few bugs,
                partly due to it being put online but I still had many ideas on how to improve at the end of the course.
            </p>
            <h3>HCD</h3>
            <p>This was a really fun project to work on. I started of with the idea of a sound graph, but with tests and
                experience it transformed to lines going up and down, moving shapes and the addition to emoji's and
                subtitles. It was really fun to dive into the requirements of one specific person and find creative
                solutions to common problems</p>
