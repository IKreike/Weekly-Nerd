            <h2>Declarative design</h2>
            <p>Jeremy (schrijver)</p>
            <p>(datum)</p>
            <p>There are two approaches to design in the workfield, declarative and imperative. Neither is wrong,
                neither is right, but we are gonna go over some highlights of both methods.</p>
            <h3>First, the basis [3]</h3>
            <p>With imperative design you work with precise instructions.
                With declarative design you work with the output you want and let the software think about how to get
                there.</p>
            <h3>How does this apply in the World Wide Web</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Html – declarative</li>
                <li>Css - declarative</li>
                <li>Js – imperative</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This makes both html and css fault tolerant, while javascript stops execution if there is an error in the
                code</p>
            <p class="quote">“javascript should only do what only javascript can do” [quote]</p>
            <h3>Why does it matter</h3>
            <p>This distinction between mindsets is, in the root, a difference in control. Why do you choose to make
                your own button, or to trust the browser to make one for you. Do you see the code the browser gives you
                as features or as bugs? My advise- let the browser work for you. </p>
                <h3>something about assumtions</h3>
                <p>make more text here</p>
                <p class="quote">Be the browsers mentor (imperative) not its micromanager (declarative)</p>
            <h3>thinking about thinking </h3>
            <p>text here as well- systems in the real world</p>

                <p>This lecture by Jeremy was really interesting, and he is a really good storyteller. You could tell he is willing to share his experience and knowledge and is not trying to sell us anything. Key points are:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Find the culture that fits</li>
    <li>Find the way of working that fits for you</li>
    <li>Find yourself</li>
</ol>
